The methods described when talking about [coordinate system transformations](transformations.html) can be used to apply affine transformations to objects on the `Graphics` surface. However, sometimes you may also want to apply some sort of arbitrary transformation to a `GraphicsPath` or to a `Graphics` object. You can do so by using their `Transform` method, with the overload that takes a `Func<Point, Point>` delegate.

## The `GraphicsPath.Transform` method

The `GraphicsPath.Transform` method takes a single parameter, which is a `Func<Point, Point>` delegate. This should be a method that, given a single `Point` as an argument, returns a new `Point` corresponding to the transformed point. When this method is used, arc segments are transformed into BÃ©zier segments, and then all the end points of the segments, as well as all control points, are transformed using the supplied transformation method.

Since the path is not linearised before applying the transformation, you should keep in mind the following:

* If you are sure that the transformation is an affine transformation, you can apply it without any pre-processing.
* If instead the transformation is a projective transformation, you should linearise the path before applying it.
* If the transformation is not a projective transformation, in addition to linearising the path, you should make sure that the line segments that compose the path are not too long (this is because a non-projective transformation transforms lines into curves, thus having line segments that are too long might produce an inaccurate result).

The following example shows how to apply a non-projective transformation.

## The `Graphics.Transform` method

The `Graphics.Transform` method can be used to do the same thing as the `Transform` method of the `GraphicsPath` class. This method has three overloads: an overload that takes six `double` parameter describing an affine transformation matrix, which has already been discussed in the context of [coordinate system transformations](transformations.html), and two overloads whose first parameter is a `Func<Point, Point>` like the `GraphicsPath.Transform` method.

One of these overloads takes just another parameter, a `double` representing the linearisation resolution; when this overload is used, the `Graphics` is linearised using the specified linearisation resolution, and then the transformation function is applied. The other overload, instead, in addition to the `linearisationResolution` also takes another parameter, representing the maximum length of any line segment in the plot. When this method is used, in addition to linearising all paths in the plot, line segments that are longer than the specified length are also divided in smaller segments, using a similar approach as the one used in the example above.

As discussed above, you should use the overload accepting only the linearisation resolution for transformations that you are sure are projective transformations; for generic transformations, you should use the overload that takes a maximum segment length as well.

The following example shows how to apply a non-projective transformation.
